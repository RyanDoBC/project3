        <p>A teacher once told me that they love Seattle because we've got just about everything here. The city, the beach, the ocean, the mountains, the forests. They also mentioned that this is one of the few areas in the US where you can go to the beach in the summer, then go snowboarding in the winter. See, they make some very good points that I do agree with. But I've gotta be honest. For me, it's the food. It always has been, and it always will be. So that's why I put together this list of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Seattle. Those count as tourist attractions, right?</p>
