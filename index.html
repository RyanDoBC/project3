            <h1>My favorite city: Seattle, WA</h1>
        </header>
        
        <main>
            <p>Someone once told me that they love Seattle because we've got just about everything here. The city, the beach, the ocean, the mountains, the forests, etc. They also mentioned that this is one of the few areas in the US where you can go to the beach in the summer, then go snowboarding in the winter.</p>
            <p>See, they made some very good points that I do agree with. But I've gotta be honest. For me, it's the food. It always has been, and it always will be. So that's why I put together this list of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Seattle. Those count as tourist attractions, right?</p>
            <p>Disclaimer: This will be in no particular order because I love all of these spots in their own ways. I'm not gonna say any of them are better than another. They're different. It just depends what you're craving at the time.</p>

                <h3><a href= "https://beechershandmadecheese.com/">#1 Beecher's</a></h3>
                    <img src="mac.jpg" alt="A bowl of Beecher's mac and cheese" width="200" id="img1">
                    <p>I'm just gonna get this one out of the way first because we all knew it was coming. Beecher's is one of Seattle's most iconic restaurants, and for good reason. Their cheddar has won them multiple awards from the American Cheese Society. Their self proclaimed "World's Best" Mac and Cheese is to die for. And their "Flagship Grilled Cheese" tastes just as good as it looks. If you're ever at Pike Place, it's pretty much mandatory that you stop by.</p>

            <section id="second">
                <h3><a href= "https://west.pelicanausa.com/">#2 Pelicana Chicken</a></h3>
                    <img src="Pelicana.jpg" alt="Pelicana Chicken storefront, Shanghai location" width="200" id="img2">
                    <p>Pelicana Chicken is a Korean fried chicken chain based in Gyeryong, South Chungcheong Province, South Korea. They opened a location right here in Seattle fairly recently in 2021. So if you want an authentic Korean fried chicken experience without having to fly to Korea, this is about as close as it gets. I can't decide if my favorite flavor is their "Original" or "Soy". Every time I visit, it seems to change depending on my mood. So I recommend you try both of those as well as their "Cheese" flavor. Amazing, big, juicy, crunchy, flavorful wings every time.</p>

            <h3><a href= "https://www.hot-mamaspizza.com/">#3 Hot Mama's Pizza</a></h3>
                <img src="Pizza.jpg" alt="Hot Mama's Pizza storefront, close up view of window and signs" width="200" id="img3">
                <p>Hot Mama's Pizza is another local favorite that's been around since 1995. They're known for their authentic New York style pizza, even offering pizza by the slice. Having an option like this available on the West Coast sure is nice. Whether you're from New York and feeling homesick or just wanna give it a try, I'm sure you'll find something you like. I personally recommend the "Pesto" and the "Pepperoni". This place also just so happens to be right down the street from Pelicana. How convenient. I will neither confirm nor deny having a full meal at Pelicana Chicken, just to stumble on down to Hot Mama's Pizza right afterwards.</p>

                <h3><a href= "https://www.takuseattle.com/">#4 Taku</a></h3>
                    <img src="Taku.jpg" alt="Taku storefront, clear view of sign" width="200" id="img4">
                    <p>Taku's a cute little spot that some might call claustrophobic, but I call it intimate. It's a great spot to grab a drink and a quick bite. I'm a big fan of the "Umeboshi" which can be a bit strong for some people, but that's exactly how I like my cocktails. I also recommend the "F*ck It Bucket" which is an enormous bucket of 2 pounds of nuggets and 1 pound of furikake fries. Their Japanese Mac Salad is also dangerously addicting.</p>

            <section id="fifth">
            <h3><a href= "https://saltandstraw.com/">#5 Salt and Straw</a></h3>
                <img src="Salt%20and%20Straw.jpg" alt="Salt and Straw storefront, slightly obscured view of sign" width="200" id="img5">
                <p>Okay, you know this list wouldn't be complete without some dessert. For that, I can't think of a better spot than Salt and Straw. Pricey, but let's just say you get what you pay for. I can't get enough of their "Coffee and Love Nuts" and "Double Fold Vanilla". But if you're feeling extra adventurous, they also have insane flavors like "Arbequina Olive Oil" and "Pear and Blue Cheese". If you manage to try everything on their menu, worry not as they do have seasonal flavors constantly rotating as well.</p>

            <h2>Fun facts aboout the city:</h2>
                <p>All of the restaurants listed above are actually within 15m of each other. See, that's another thing about this city that I really like. It's pretty walkable. That's a relief considering how nonsensical these endless one-way streets are in addition to the nonexistent parking sometimes. But I suppose that's to be expected in a city with a population of over 750,000. The geography is also partially responsible for the confusing streets, by the way. It all started Denny and Carson D. Boren wanted their streets to follow the Elliot Bay shoreline, while David Swinson Maynard wanted his to follow cardinal directions. The result is the spiderweb that we have today. It's not perfect by any means. But at least now you understand why it is the way that it is. Love it or hate it, it's here to stay.</p>
